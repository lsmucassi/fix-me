The client that receives and send back buy messages and, or orders to the server to communicate with the broker

A market has a list of instruments that can be traded. When orders are received from
brokers the market tries to execute it. If the execution is successfully, it updates the
internal instrument list and sends the broker an Executed message. If the order can’t be
met, the market sends a Rejected message.
The rules by which a market executes orders can be complex and you can play with
them. This is why you build the simulator. Some simple rules that you need to respect
is that an order can’t be executed if the instrument is not traded on the market or if the
demanded quantity is not available (in case of Buy orders).
