The Server package, also know as the router, base communication centre between broker and market

The router is the central component of the applications. All other components connect
to it in order to send messages to other components. The router will perform no buiness
logic, it will just dispatch messages to the destination component(s). The router must
accept incomming connections from multiple brokers and markets. We call the router a
market connetivity provider, because it allows brokers to send messages (in FIX format)
to markets, without depending on specific implementation of the market.
